 tWelcome to Java Challenges!

This document is a step-by-step instructions to solving the following challenges.

Even if you are already familiar with Java basics, stepping through this guide
may be helpful as it will help you understand the output from the tool, Gradle,
that we use to compile and test our code, as well as introduce some of the
patterns common to all exercises in this track.

# Challenge Structure

When you fetch a new Java challenge, you will receive:

* __one or more test files__ (always). These live in the `src/test/java`
directory and define a set of tests that our solution must satisfy before we
can safely declare that it is working.
* __one or more starter files__ (initially). If provided, these live in the
`src/main/java` directory and define shells of the classes you will need
in order to solve the current problem.

# Solving Each Challenge

Your environment has already been set up for you.

## Testing your Solution

When a task is successful, it generally does not output anything. Below are tasks for you to complete. Write the code in your code editor to complete each task, then press  <i class="md-icon fas fa-play"></i>. Once you’ve run your code, click the square next to the task. This will automatically check your code and turn into a green tick if you’ve done it correctly! If the checks do not pass, expand the task to see why. You can retry a task as many times as you’d like.

Once completed you can move on to the next challenge!
